        <p>I am posting day 22’s blog a day late due to an outage at work that took precedence. However, you can see from my <a href="https://github.com/aaronreidsmith/advent-of-code/commit/0f0559fb30044848b0985e732497dc6674798158">git history</a> that the code itself was written on the 22nd.</p>

<p>I solved the first half of the problem in Raku and then <em>tried</em> to write the second half in Raku but got stuck, so this is the first problem where each half was solved in a different language.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<h3 id="part-1">Part 1</h3>

<p>Our last mode of transportation is a raft and are bored out of our minds. There is a little crab on our raft, and we decide to play a class game of <a href="https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/">War</a>.</p>

<p>The rules are simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each player has a deck of cards (the decks do not have any duplicate values).</li>
  <li>Each turn each player reveals the top card in their deck. Whomever’s is bigger wins the round and puts both cards on the bottom of their deck, with the bigger card on top.</li>
  <li>When one player gets <em>all</em> the cards in their deck, that player wins</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-- Round 1 --
Player 1's deck: 9, 2, 6, 3, 1
Player 2's deck: 5, 8, 4, 7, 10
Player 1 plays: 9
Player 2 plays: 5
Player 1 wins the round!

-- Round 2 --
Player 1's deck: 2, 6, 3, 1, 9, 5
Player 2's deck: 8, 4, 7, 10
Player 1 plays: 2
Player 2 plays: 8
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 3 --
Player 1's deck: 6, 3, 1, 9, 5
Player 2's deck: 4, 7, 10, 8, 2
Player 1 plays: 6
Player 2 plays: 4
Player 1 wins the round!

-- Round 4 --
Player 1's deck: 3, 1, 9, 5, 6, 4
Player 2's deck: 7, 10, 8, 2
Player 1 plays: 3
Player 2 plays: 7
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 5 --
Player 1's deck: 1, 9, 5, 6, 4
Player 2's deck: 10, 8, 2, 7, 3
Player 1 plays: 1
Player 2 plays: 10
Player 2 wins the round!

...several more rounds pass...

-- Round 27 --
Player 1's deck: 5, 4, 1
Player 2's deck: 8, 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6
Player 1 plays: 5
Player 2 plays: 8
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 28 --
Player 1's deck: 4, 1
Player 2's deck: 9, 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5
Player 1 plays: 4
Player 2 plays: 9
Player 2 wins the round!

-- Round 29 --
Player 1's deck: 1
Player 2's deck: 7, 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4
Player 1 plays: 1
Player 2 plays: 7
Player 2 wins the round!


== Post-game results ==
Player 1's deck: 
Player 2's deck: 3, 2, 10, 6, 8, 5, 9, 4, 7, 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When we get to the end, we can calculate the winning player’s score like this, here each position’s value is its card value multiplied by its position from the bottom of the deck:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   3 * 10
+  2 *  9
+ 10 *  8
+  6 *  7
+  8 *  6
+  5 *  5
+  9 *  4
+  4 *  3
+  7 *  2
+  1 *  1
= 306
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>What is the winning player’s score with the actual input?</p>

<h4 id="solution">Solution</h4>

<p><a href="https://github.com/aaronreidsmith/advent-of-code/blob/main/2020/22/raku/main.raku">GitHub Link</a></p>

<p>See below for explanation and any implementation-specific comments.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sub calculate-score(@deck) {
    @deck.reverse.kv.map(-&gt; $index, $value { ($index + 1) * $value }).sum;
}

sub play-game(@player1, @player2) {
    if @player1.elems == 0 {
        calculate-score(@player2);
    } elsif @player2.elems == 0 {
        calculate-score(@player1);
    } else {
        my $player1-card = @player1.head;
        my $player2-card = @player2.head;
        if $player1-card &gt; $player2-card {
            play-game(
                (|@player1[1..*], $player1-card, $player2-card),
                @player2[1..*]
            );
        } else {
            play-game(
                @player1[1..*],
                (|@player2[1..*], $player2-card, $player1-card)
            );
        }
    }
}

sub MAIN($file) {
    my ($player1-str, $player2-str) = $file.IO.lines(:nl-in("\n\n"));
    my @player1 = $player1-str.lines[1..*].map(*.Int);
    my @player2 = $player2-str.lines[1..*].map(*.Int);
    say play-game(@player1, @player2);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This runs as such:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ raku main.raku input.txt

</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="explanation">Explanation</h4>

<p>I guess it is worth saying that our input looks like this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Player 1:

<p>Most of the stuff that happens in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MAIN</code> is just parsing that into two lists of integers. We then pass those lists to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">play-game</code>, which has very simple logic:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If one player has zero cards, return the score of the other player</li>
  <li>Otherwise, pull their top cards and compare them. The player with the higher card put their card on the bottom of the deck <em>and then</em> the loser’s card on the bottom of their deck.</li>
  <li>Play the game recursively until our end condition is met</li>
</ol>

<p>Other than the main logic, our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calculate-score</code> does it’s job by reversing the list then multiplying each item by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$index + 1</code> (since we measure distance from the bottom), then summing.</p>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h3 id="part-2">Part 2</h3>

<p>Now we challenge the crab to a game of <strong>Recursive War</strong>. Recursive War is similar to regular War, with the following changes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Before either player deals a card, if there was a previous round in this game that had exactly the same cards in the same order in the same players’ decks, the game instantly ends in a win for player 1. Previous rounds from other games are not considered. (This prevents infinite games of Recursive Combat, which everyone agrees is a bad idea.)</li>
  <li>Otherwise, this round’s cards must be in a new configuration; the players begin the round by each drawing the top card of their deck as normal.</li>
  <li>If both players have at least as many cards remaining in their deck as the value of the card they just drew, the winner of the round is determined by playing a new game of Recursive Combat (see below).</li>
  <li>Otherwise, at least one player must not have enough cards left in their deck to recurse; the winner of the round is the player with the higher-value card.</li>
</ul>

<p>To play a sub-game of Recursive Combat, each player creates a new deck by making a copy of the next cards in their deck (the quantity of cards copied is equal to the number on the card they drew to trigger the sub-game). During this sub-game, the game that triggered it is on hold and completely unaffected; no cards are removed from players’ decks to form the sub-game. (For example, if player 1 drew the 3 card, their deck in the sub-game would be copies of the next three cards in their deck.)</p>

<p>Here is an example of a recursive combat game (sorry it’s so long…):</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This runs as such:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ python main.py input.txt
33745
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="explanation-1">Explanation</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__main__</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">calculate_score</code> functions are the same as their Raku counterparts; what changed here was <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">play_game</code>. We basically follow the following logic:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If we have seen this orientation (in this game or sub-game), player 1 wins immediately</li>
  <li>Otherwise, we draw our cards</li>
  <li>If we have both enough cards for a sub game (“enough” is an amount greater than the card we drew), then play a sub-game to determine the winner</li>
  <li>Once the winner is determined (either through a sub game or just comparing cards), add the cards to the bottom of the winner’s deck as normal.</li>
  <li>Repeat until one player has all the cards!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I wrote part one at 6am and wrote part two around 10pm yesterday. I probably could have gotten it working in Raku, but I was hoping to do a puzzle a day for the duration of AoC, so I had to do what I had to do. Hopefully I will get back on track today and finish out the week (and the month) strong!</p>
