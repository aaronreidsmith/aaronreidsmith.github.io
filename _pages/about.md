Hi, I'm Aaron!

I'm Aaron Smith, a Senior Data Engineer at [IronNet Cybersecurity](https://www.ironnet.com/) and an active contributor to Python's leading equivalent to R's `auto.arima`, [`pmdarima`](https://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima). My current work is focused on migrating legacy Spark infrastructure to Kafka-based streaming infrastructure.

This site is, primarily, a place to post blogs about the [Perl Weekly Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/), but may spread out into more topics.
