Hi, I'm Aaron!

I'm a Data Engineer at [Sumo Logic](http://www.sumologic.com) and an active contributor to Python's leading equivalent to R's auto.arima, [`pmdarima`](http://github.com/alkaline-ml/pmdarima). My current work is focused on processing billions of data points per day using Scala and Kafka Streams.

This site is, primarily, a place to post blogs about the [Perl Weekly Challenge](https://perlweeklychallenge.org/), but may spread out into more topics.
