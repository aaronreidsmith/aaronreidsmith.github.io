Today is Father's Day in the U.S. I have an almost-11-month-old son who I should be spending time with, but I feel the need to post a blog because I have been doing so weekly since November 2020. However, I find no joy in it today or even recently. I still enjoy doing the occasional Perl Weekly Challenge (I was only able to get [Part 1](https://github.com/manwar/perlweeklychallenge-club/blob/master/challenge-117/aaronreidsmith/raku/ch-1.raku) done before the deadline this week), but writing about it has become a source of burnout. I don't even think I have readers out there, but I figured it would be worth sharing my thoughts on the matter rather than just disappearing. I will still blog from time to time, but I will no longer put the pressure on myself to do it weekly. With that, I am going to go spend time with my family.

Cheers,  
Aaron
